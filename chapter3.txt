    Complete Chapter 1





// git commit -m  command -m flag is used to add a commit message, commit message is really imp as it helps to track of what changes have been made in each commit. So whenever you create a new save point , you have to be as explicit as possible about what changes were made between the last save point and the current save point.

=> Here we can write "Initial commit" as  message for the initial commit which shows that this is our starting point, 
Alternatively we can be slightly more specific by writing commit message as "Complete Chapter 1" 
Since i have already add all 4 chapters to staging are then i can write
git commit -m "All Chapters Complete"  in the comple message.
=> commit messages are always written in the present tense.
