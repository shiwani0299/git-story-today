It wa the age of wisdom, It was the age of foolishness
It was the epoch of belief, It was the epoch of incredulity
It was the season of Light, It was the season of Darkness
It was the spring of hope, It was the winter of despair
We had everything before us, we had nothing before us
Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities
The 19th century was a time of great change. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing,
and the world was changing at a rapid pace. The 19th century was also a time of
great conflict. The Napoleonic Wars raged across Europe, and the American Civil War
was fought in the United States. The 19th century was a time of great change, and
it was also a time of great conflict.
